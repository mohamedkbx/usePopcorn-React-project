# UsePopcorn Project

## Overview

Welcome to the UsePopcorn project! This project is built using React and focuses on creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience for managing and viewing movie data.

## Key Principles

### Logical Separation

All components are logically separated to ensure clarity and maintainability. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the application, making the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

### Reusability

Components are designed with reusability in mind. By creating modular and reusable components, we reduce redundancy and improve the efficiency of the development process.

### Responsibility

Each component adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This means that every component has a single responsibility, making it easier to manage, test, and debug.

### Complexity Management

We manage complexity by breaking down large components into smaller, more manageable pieces. This approach helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase, ensuring that each component is easy to understand and work with.
